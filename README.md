# Patrick Bauer's Portfolio

## Description
This web project is to showcase all the exciting things I have worked on and several things that I enjoy.
I started this portfolio project in July 2023. I expect to learn about the following topics:
* web based 3d rendering
* 3d modeling
* 3d animations
* storytelling through technology

## Technology used for this project
* React
* three.js
* Github
* Firebase

## Ideas for what to display in the 3d environment:
This section includes my ideas for what to display for each of my previous experiences.
The general idea is to create a museum or art gallery to disply what I've worked on and what I enjoy.
Inspiration for this is "The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe Edition" museum ending.
